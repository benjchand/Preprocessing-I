        <p>I am a real archiologist who has spent years both teaching and in the field discovering amazing items of both religious and historical significance.  While, unfortunately, most of these items were destroyed in the process of bringing them to light, some are on display in my local museum.</p>

        <h3>My Views on Archeology</h3>
        <p>Unlike a lot of my collegues, I believe in a strong "hands-on" approach when it comes to research.  More often than not, my students will tell me after the semester how much they enjoyed my missing office hours, giving tests, and especially being able to give them grades.  I believe that all students who hear my amazing stories are the best archiologists they could be, so I simply give them all A's at the end of the semester. Despite the bad press I have been receiving and the countries I have been "banned" from, no one is better at finding the impossible than me.</p>
